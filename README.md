# Chrono Sum

A browser-only web app entirely developed by me(including styling) using React.js. The main functionality of this app is to perform various kinds of math operations using time.

For now, there is only one tool where you can input a specific time and how much hours, minutes, seconds and miliseconds you want to add to that time(for subtraction use a minus sign). I plan on adding much more to this app before i mark it as done, mainly mobile support, responsiveness(currently only on Full HD 1920X1080 an upwards) and other functionalities.

## Lessons Learned

The main thing this project demanded was pure javascript logic to execute the time math  correctly and display the numbers in the right way when needed. I also learned more about React states as it uses a bunch of them in different ways.
